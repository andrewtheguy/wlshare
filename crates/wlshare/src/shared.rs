//! What the compositor thread and the client sessions share, and the two
//! channels between them.
//!
//! The compositor side is one thread that owns the Wayland connection
//! ([`crate::compositor`]); clients are tokio tasks ([`crate::session`]). They
//! meet in three places, all here: the [`Framebuffer`] behind a mutex, a
//! `watch` that ticks when it changes, and a broadcast of [`Event`]s for what a
//! frame cannot carry. Sessions talk back through [`Command`]s on a calloop
//! channel the compositor thread polls beside the Wayland socket.
