//! The desktop's sound: a PipeWire capture of the monitor of wlshare's own
//! sink, one per client that enabled audio, in the format that client asked for
//! and encoded as FLAC.
//!
//! wlshare runs inside the user's session, where the audio graph is, so it
//! reads what the desktop plays the same way it reads what the desktop draws:
//! from the compositor's side, with nothing configured on the client. While any
//! client listens, the desktop plays into a [`Speaker`], a null sink of
//! wlshare's own, rather than into the host's: the sound goes where the client
//! is, and the room the host is in stays silent, the way a remote desktop's
//! sound does. The capture is a `Stream/Input/Audio` node with
//! `stream.capture.sink` set and the speaker as its target, which is
//! PipeWire's word for "the monitor of that sink". PipeWire converts the
//! graph's own rate and sample format into the client's, and is asked for
//! buffers of twenty milliseconds — one FLAC frame's worth, and one Opus
//! packet's at the gateway.
//!
//! Per client rather than shared, because the format is the client's choice
//! and two clients may choose differently; a capture stream is cheap, and a
//! desktop with two listeners is rare. The speaker is shared: every capture
//! reads the one sink the desktop plays into. Nothing runs while no client has
//! enabled audio: a capture's stream, its thread and its PipeWire connection
//! exist between an enable and the disable or disconnect that ends it, and the
//! speaker from the first listener's enable to the last one's end.
//!
//! PipeWire's loop wants a thread of its own, so each capture is one, and the
//! process callback runs on that loop rather than on the graph's real-time
//! thread — `RT_PROCESS` is deliberately not set. The callback encodes the
//! buffer ([`FlacEncoder`]) and queues the frames it completes, which
//! allocates, takes a mutex and wakes a task, and none of that is real-time
//! safe: run on the data thread it could stall the whole audio graph and give
//! every application on the host an xrun. The thread this capture already owns
//! is the right place for it, and off the session's task, which has pixels to
//! compress; a twenty-millisecond buffer takes a fraction of a millisecond to
//! encode. A session that falls behind loses the oldest frames, never the
//! newest, so what it does send is live, and each FLAC frame decodes on its
//! own, so a lost one costs the client nothing but its own samples.
