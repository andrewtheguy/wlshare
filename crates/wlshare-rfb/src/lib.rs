//! The RFB wire wlshare speaks.
//!
//! Everything that decides bytes on the socket lives here and nowhere else: the
//! handshake pieces, the client messages and how they parse, the server messages
//! and how they are built, RSA-AES, the ZRLE encoder and the private extensions
//! — and, in [`client`], [`zrle::ZrleDecoder`] and [`rsa_aes::begin`], the same
//! wire from a client's end. The daemon crate turns compositor events into calls
//! on this crate and copies the results to sockets, and the client crate does the
//! same with a window's; neither writes a protocol byte of its own.
//!
//! The crate is platform-independent so that all of it is unit-tested on any
//! machine, the daemon being buildable only where libwayland and libxkbcommon
//! are. Tests here use an independent decoder for every encoder, so the two
//! halves cannot share a misunderstanding.
//!
//! ## What is on the wire, and what is not
//!
//! RFB 3.8 as RFC 6143 has it, with these choices:
//!
//! - **ZRLE, and VP9 for a client that lists it.** ZRLE is the standard's best
//!   lossless encoding, every client worth naming decodes it, and the remotex
//!   gateway asks for it first. **The VP9 encoding** is a private one for
//!   wlshare's own desktop clients: the whole framebuffer as one 4:4:4 VP9
//!   stream at a quality its owner sets ([`vp9`]), for a desktop that moves. Raw is
//!   produced only before the client's first `SetEncodings`, where the RFC
//!   requires it, and for a client whose list names neither. Tight, Hextile,
//!   RRE, CopyRect and every other lossy encoding are absent.
//! - **32-bit true colour only.** The server's native format is the compositor's
//!   XRGB8888, which is the `B, G, R, X` byte order the gateway forces. A client may
//!   ask for any 32-bit true-colour format with 8-bit channels and gets it by a
//!   swizzle; 8- and 16-bit formats and colour maps are refused.
//! - **ContinuousUpdates and Fence**, so a client that supports them gets frames
//!   as the screen changes with one update in flight, instead of polling.
//! - **Cursor**, required of every client, so the compositor pointer stays out
//!   of captured pixels and its shape moves immediately at the client; and
//!   **Cursor With Alpha**, for a client that lists it, so the shape keeps its
//!   shadow and edges ([`cursor`]).
//! - **DesktopSize and ExtendedDesktopSize**, so a client may resize the desktop.
//! - **The density extension**, one pseudo-encoding and one message type, which
//!   is how a client learns the scale the framebuffer is drawn at and asks for
//!   the one it wants ([`density`]).
//! - **The outputs extension**, another pair of the same shape, which is how a
//!   client learns which outputs the compositor has and asks for the one it
//!   wants shared ([`outputs`]).
//! - **The audio extension**, a private pseudo-encoding and message type, which
//!   carries the desktop's sound over the same connection as FLAC, lossless, in
//!   the format the client chose; the client's messages and the stream's begin
//!   and end are the QEMU Audio extension's ([`audio`]).
//! - **The camera extension**, a third private pair, which is how a client lends
//!   the desktop a camera: the client plugs it and sends H.264, and the server
//!   says when the desktop's applications want frames ([`camera`]).
//! - **The microphone extension**, the camera's twin and a fourth private pair,
//!   which is how a client lends the desktop a microphone: the client plugs it,
//!   and sends 16-bit PCM in the format the server names while the desktop's
//!   applications record ([`microphone`]).
//! - **Extended Clipboard**, the registered one and the only clipboard spoken:
//!   text as UTF-8, notified and then asked for ([`clipboard`]). Latin-1 cut
//!   text is framed so that it can be skipped, and otherwise ignored.
//! - **None and RSA-AES** for security. The first is RFC 6143's; the second is
//!   RealVNC's, and the one way a client can name an account and have the
//!   session encrypted ([`rsa_aes`]). Classic VncAuth is deliberately absent: it
//!   names nobody and encrypts nothing after the login. Which is offered is the
//!   daemon's configuration; the crate speaks both.
