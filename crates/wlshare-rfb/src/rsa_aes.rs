//! RealVNC's RSA-AES security types (RFB 5 and 129), server side: an
//! authenticated, encrypted RFB session over an ordinary 3.8 wire, and the one
//! standard way a client can tell this server *who* is connecting.
//!
//! The types are RealVNC's, documented in the community `rfbproto` and spoken
//! on the open side by TigerVNC, neatvnc and the remotex gateway, whose client
//! this server was written against. RSA-AES carries either a username and a
//! password, so they can be checked against the system's accounts, or a
//! password alone ([`Subtype`]), and every byte after the key exchange is
//! inside AES-EAX — which classic VncAuth, deliberately not spoken here, never
//! did: it proves knowledge of a machine's secret and encrypts nothing.
//!
//! ## The exchange
//!
//! ```text
//! server → client   u32 bits || modulus || exponent        the server's RSA key
//! client → server   u32 bits || modulus || exponent        the client's, fresh per session
//! server → client   u16 len  || RSA-PKCS1v15(client key, server random)
//! client → server   u16 len  || RSA-PKCS1v15(server key, client random)
//! ```
//!
//! The server speaks first at every step, as the protocol has it and as
//! TigerVNC's server does, so a client that waits for each server message
//! before answering never waits on a server doing the same. Both randoms known,
//! each direction gets its own AES key:
//!
//! ```text
//! client → server   H(server random || client random)[..key]
//! server → client   H(client random || server random)[..key]
//! ```
//!
//! `H` is SHA-1 for the 128-bit type and SHA-256 for the 256-bit one, the random
//! is 16 or 32 bytes to match, and from here every byte in both directions is a
//! [frame](Sealer::frame). Inside the frames: the server's hash of the two public
//! keys, the client's hash of them the other way round (which binds the session
//! to the keys that were actually sent — a middle-man's substitution shows up
//! here), a one-byte subtype saying which credentials the server wants, the
//! credentials, then RFB's own SecurityResult and everything after it.
//!
//! ## The client random as an oracle
//!
//! RSA-PKCS#1 v1.5 is the padding the protocol fixes, and a server that says
//! whether a ciphertext unpadded is the oracle Bleichenbacher's attack needs —
//! against a key that is the same for every connection. So the decryption is
//! blinded, and it never fails, in what it returns or in how it gets there: the
//! raw exponentiation is followed by this module's own unpadding, which checks
//! the fixed shape `00 02 PS 00 random` with the random's known length in
//! constant time and selects, byte by byte and without a branch, between the
//! bytes found there and a substitute derived from a per-process secret and the
//! ciphertext — the substitute computed for every ciphertext, valid or not. The
//! exchange goes on to the hash step exactly as it would have, and the client's
//! hash frame then fails its tag, which is all a wrong ciphertext ever looks like
//! from outside, and is what an honest client with a wrong key would have got
//! too. The `rsa` crate's own PKCS#1 v1.5 decryption is not used: it returns an
//! error on bad padding, and an error is a branch.
//!
//! ## What the server's key is worth
//!
//! The server's key is the one thing a client can pin. It is generated once and
//! kept in a file, so its fingerprint — RealVNC's eight dashed SHA-1 bytes,
//! which this module logs at startup and the remotex gateway logs on every
//! connection — is stable and an operator can compare the two. Against an
//! active middle-man the pinning is the client's to do; against a passive one
//! the session is encrypted.
//!
//! ## The frame
//!
//! ```text
//! wire   u16 len || byte[len] AES-EAX ciphertext || byte[16] tag
//! nonce  a 128-bit little-endian counter, from zero, one per frame per direction
//! aad    the two length bytes
//! ```
//!
//! A frame is a transport unit and not a message: a framebuffer update spans as
//! many frames as it needs, so the read side is an [`AsyncRead`] yielding the
//! concatenation of frame bodies and the write side takes a whole message and
//! cuts it. The counter is the nonce, so a frame is decrypted exactly once and
//! in order; a reader that has failed is finished.
