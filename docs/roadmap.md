# Roadmap

Work that is planned but not started. Once something here is done, its design
moves to [`architecture.md`](architecture.md) and it comes off this list.

## The tiles' cache

What is left of what RDP's graphics pipeline does without AVC, once the
client keeps a cache of tiles ([What it was shown is a cached
tile](architecture.md#the-tiles-encoding)). Each is measured as the cache
was: `tile-recurrence` for what a rule would serve, then the tiles-only
passes of motion-bench against [the cache's
rows](tiles-performance.md#the-cache).

- **A larger cache kept as the coded stills.** 16384 slots serve 18% of the
  mixed session's stills at 2880x1800@2 where 4096 serve 13%, but as pixels
  they are 256 MiB in a tab. Kept as the stills that were sent, about
  2.5 KB a tile, they are 40 MB, decoded again on a draw, which is a hit's
  cost in the page rather than a still's on the link.

## Progressive tiles

What is left of the progressive picture, every tile of a walked list
([On a walked list, every tile
progressive](architecture.md#the-tiles-encoding)), each measured as it was:
`tiles-walk-sim` against the runs in [Tiles
performance](tiles-performance.md#progressive-tiles).

- **Motion on a slow link and a large desktop.** What costs the progressive
  picture its frame rate there is a moving region coded as wavelet tiles,
  each from nothing or as a difference of its coefficients, which a P-frame
  predicted from the frame before carries in fewer bytes. The first passes
  there are already at the stage below 50, and one at half resolution
  shrinks them by 1 to 9% more ([measured](tiles-performance.md#progressive-tiles)),
  so no stage closes it: what is left is a frame rate that falls, as the
  host's does, or a moving region carried by prediction, as the walked
  tiles' H.264 regions did before progressive tiles took their place (a 4K
  window at 5 Mbit/s at 17 frames a second where these have 7).
